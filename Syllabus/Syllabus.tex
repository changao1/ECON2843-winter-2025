	{\bf Course Objective}\medskip\\
	Upon completion of this course, my goal is that you are able to: Understand why statistics is important, be familiar with statistical terms and applications, and to recognize the role of statistics in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) $-$ Large Language Models (LLMs) driven context.\bigskip\\
	\noindent {\bf Assessment Structure}\medskip\\
	Your grade will be based on 8 homework (5\% each, 40\% in total) and the higher one between: (1) $40\%\times$  final exam $+$ $20\%\times$ optional midterm exam, (2) $60\%\times$ final exam. This means if your final exam grade is higher than midterm, it will be used as your $60\%$ course grade; {\color{blue}the midterm is truly optional}.\medskip\\
	Homework will be online through the McGraw-Hill Connect platform. You could have multiple attempts for the homeworks, there is no time limit to work on them as long as you submit them before the deadline of 1/13/2026. Each homework contains 20-30 multiple choice as well as some true/false questions.\medskip\\
	Both the midterm (optional) and final exam (not optional) will be online through the McGraw-Hill Connect platform, they will be open-book exams. You will have $\ge$ 50 hours windows (for each one) to pick a time to take the exams at your convenience, the length of midterm exam will be 90 minutes and the length of final exam will be 120 minutes. The optional midterm contains 30-40 multiple choice questions, the final contains 50-60 multiple choice questions. The midterm exam covers section 1 and 2, the final exam covers all the sections. For each of the exams, {\color{blue}only 1 attempt is allowed}. The optional midterm dues on 1/5/2026 and the final exam dues on 1/16/2026.\bigskip\\

Business Statistics: Communicating with numbers by Jaggia and Kelly. You can access the ebook from McGraw-Hill Connect.\bigskip\\
